            At Lyttone everybody loves books, and everybody loves audio. 
            That's why we've been providing casting, recording, directing, proofing, mixing and mastering for audiobooks for many years. 
            We have successfully delivered books in many genres, including fiction, non-fiction, children's, science and more!

-----------------------------

This are the services we provide to create audiobooks
------------------
Assesment
-----------------------
We read the book, and based on our knowledge we suggest the best approach to take your book from print to audio. 
                                        We listen to your opinion, and your suggestions based on your knowledge of the book and the intended audience. Once we all agree on the route, we are ready for Talent Selection
--------------------

Talent Selection
--------------------------
            We offer you 3 ways to select the right talent for your audiobook: we can select the most adequate candidates from our roster of Voice Actors and let you pick one of them, listening to them read some of your book; we can make this selection ourselves; or you may want to bring in your preferred talent, be it the author or any Voice Actor of your choice.

Recording and editing
--------------------------
Time to record! The voice talent, the director and the producer convene in our studio and the actual recording takes place. The book will take several recording sessions. 
            Once everything is recorded, we carefully edit and mix the material, and pass it to the Proofing stage

-------------------------------------------
Proofing
----------------------------
            Our Proofers review all the material, checking accuracy, pronunciations, quality of sound. They send back a list of the issues found to the producer, and the editing or re-recording necessary take place as soon as possible.
         

---------------------
Mastering and Delivery
------------------------------
Final stage! We take the audio to the specification of every platform you intend to sell your audiobook on, and we deliver the audio files you or to those platforms or both.
